# GodotScript4Notepadplusplus
A user defined language in Notepad++ for Godot Script, updated as of Godot 4. Right now it lacks the feature for folding code/comments (not sure how to do this with gd script as it uses indentation rather than delimiters for code blocks. contains highlighting for keywords, annotations, comments, and global variables.
